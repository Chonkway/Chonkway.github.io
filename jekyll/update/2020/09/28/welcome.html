<p>This is my first main post to this site, and I don&#39;t really have much to say but hopefully I begin to fill this site out more as time progresses. As of the date of this post (September 5th, 2021) I have begun to read Hands on Machine Learning and will begin to develop a project idea down the line.</p>
<p>Check out my <a href="https://github.com/Chonkway">Github</a> for any project postings I may do. You can also reach out to me on Discord at <code>ðŸ’•Chonkwayâ„¢ðŸ’•#7954</code></p>
